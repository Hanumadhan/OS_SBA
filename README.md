Question Nos. Alloted : 10 & 23

ques10. Researchers designed one system that classified interactive and noninteractive processes
        automatically by looking at the amount of terminal I/O. If a process did not input or
        output to the terminal in a 1-second interval, the process was classified as noninteractive
        and was moved to a lower-priority queue. In response to this policy, one programmer
        modified his programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal at regular intervals 
        of less than 1 second. The system gave his programs a high priority, even though the
        terminal output was completely meaningless.
        
ques23. A uniprocessor system has n number of CPU intensive processes, each process has its
        own requirement of CPU burst.The process with lowest CPU burst is given the highest
        priority. A late arriving higher priority process can preempt a currently running process
        with lower priority. Simulate a scheduler that is scheduling the processes in such a way
        that higher priority process is never starved due to the execution of lower priority
        process. What should be its average waiting time and average turnaround time if no two
        processes are arriving at same time.
